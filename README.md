Github Repo: https://github.com/fayazhossen/raycasting-volume-rendering

## Setup Steps 
In the repo it shows how to setup with PyCharm. I have followed those initially. Then I have completed the setup with vscode with the following steps. 
- create vertual environment in project directory named venv 
   python3 -m venv venv
- activate the virtual environment 
   source venv/bin/activate
- create file requirements.txt and add the following dependencies 
    pandas
    numpy
    PyOpenGL==3.1.3rc1
    wxPython
    itk
- install the dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
- run main.py

(NB: had to change several import locations internally. Mostly had to add the package name alongside the filename)
